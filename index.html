  <p>Speedrunning is when an individual attempts to beat part or all of a video game as quickly as possible. This can include individual levels, specific objectives, or unique limitations as decided by the community or player. Players must master tricks, optimize movement, and react quickly to improve their times and try to move up the leaderboards or potentially hold a world record someday.</p>
