As a fan of speedrunning, I want to see the newest runs from my favorite players

As a follower of many speedrunners, I need a way to see the most recent submissions from my favorite runners

As a fan of speedrunning, I want a way to share my favorite runs with my friends on social media.

# The Goal
A user should be able to search for an SRC user
A user should be able to add a user to their favorites
A user should be able to recall their favorites from local storage
A user should be able to share runs on a social media platform

# How does it work?
The search function will bring up the 5 most recent runs for a user.
If a user has fewer than 5 submitted runs, it will return all runs
Users can save a runner as a favorite which will create a button
If the button is clicked, the search can be rerun at any time
